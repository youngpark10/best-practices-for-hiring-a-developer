Hiring a developer would be one of the most critical decisions for an entrepreneur to make. By making a wrong decision, you risk hurting your business, wasting precious time and money seeking a replacement. Hiring a great one becomes more important when you are trying to create a new application with new functionalities. It always pays to hire best developers. Average developers will eventually hit the point of not able to solve the problem and it will become less productive and more costly as time goes. The more pay per our more get as time passes. We had an extensive discussion on hiring a developer over the course and here are some of the highlights.
-	Look for a craftsmanship: You want to work with someone who cares about their craft. Look for a T-shaped engineer who possesses a broad range of technologies and environment while being a specialist. Generally, knowing a single language is a bad sign. Look for someone who attends tech meet ups, reads blogs. Look for an intellectual curiosity.
-	Understanding of business: Look for someone who can think big picture. You are looking for someone who can discuss how to solve business problems with you rather than just write the code. Great programmers will come up with a better solution to the given business problems.
-	Where to find them: Good developers are very hard to find these days. You want to be where these programmers hang out. A technical meetups (you can search here:[meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/)) for programmers a good place to start as you can meet developers who care about their craft and are interested in networking. Be casual and ask for ask for introductions.
-	3 Qs to ask when you meet them: This is a simple but very powerful tool to prove a technical competency of a developer. 3 questions are 1. What Version Control System do you use?  Which one do you compare it to? Why do you pick the one you pick over the other? 2. Unit Testing Tool and 3. Programming Frame works. As a business person, you don't have to validate the answers but look for logical, coherent answers along the line of ‘I use X. I compare it to Y. I chose X over Y because of A, B, and C’. If the answer makes sense to you, this means that the developer can explain complex things in plain language and that’s what you are looking for.
-	Creating a shared vision: Make sure to take the time to share your vision to convince them. If developers share your vision and passion for the problem you are trying solve, they are more likely to join you and be more effective.
